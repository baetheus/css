# CSS

This is a standalone css library--no required js, no dependencies, no footguns. I'm just tired of learning how to write easy css in complicated frameworks.

## Goals (this project should be...)

1. Modular: A strong set of utility classes
2. Small: Hard limit of 5K compressed for the full library
3. Useful: Ship with a bootstrap-esque set of semantic html styles
4. Configurable: Class naming, component styling, and feature sets should all be configurable
5. Pretty: Styling a bare html page should make it look better, not worse (think zen garden)
6. Conscientious: Accessibility should be a right, not a priveledge

## Usage

It's not done yet so don't use it!
